## PRIVACY POLICY
 
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application deLight Control (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Perceptive Tech. The Application is a controller app for use with the deLight smart illumination system. 

 
### Information Collected by Us

We don't actively collect, store, use or share any user data. We simply can't.  We have no place to store it, no servers to contact, and no endpoints to talk to.  The Application requires Location permission in order to search for deLight compatible devices in the connected wifi network, this location data is used within the device (and never leaves it) and is immediately disposed of.  It also requires Storage permission to store deLight device updates, but again, no user information of any kind is actually collected or stored (even locally).  Any provided or downloaded data the Application needs to function stays in the device its running on and is deleted upon deleting the Application.


### Contact us
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at tperceptive@gmail.com.
